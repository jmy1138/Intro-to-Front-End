# Intro to Front-End Development

A simple demo for introducing the fundamental concepts behind front-end development.


## Overview

There are five directories: a demo directory containing the final project, a boilerplate directory with a bare-bones template, and one directory for each of corresponding sessions:

1. Document structure with HTML
2. Document styling with CSS
3. Document scripting with JavaScript


## Features

* HTML5 ready. Use the new elements with confidence.
* Designed with progressive enhancement in mind.
* Includes:
  * [`Normalize.css`](https://necolas.github.com/normalize.css/)
    for CSS normalizations and common bug fixes
  * A custom build of [`Modernizr`](https://modernizr.com/) for feature
    detection
  * [`Apache Server Configs`](https://github.com/h5bp/server-configs-apache)
    that, among other, improve the web site's performance and security
* Useful CSS helper classes.
* Default print styles, performance optimized.
* An optimized version of the Google Universal Analytics snippet.
* Protection against any stray `console` statements causing JavaScript
  errors in older browsers.
* "Delete-key friendly." Easy to strip out parts you don't need.

## Documentation

Take a look at the [documentation table of contents](Docs/TOC.md).

any documentation you want to write about your project.
